        <p>My name is Hamzah. I'm currently a Year Up student who's developing an academic career in software
            development. Through my past experience in this field I'm looking forward to creating higher level
            programming skills with this education. My unique value is that I have the ability to understand complex
            problems and break it down well enough to visualize the solution in a simplistic way. My goal is to become a
            successful front-end developer and land a job at an advanced tech company where I can be financially stable.
